**This application was forked from [microservices-demo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo), used to demonstrate how to build micro servics with [go-micro](https://github.com/go-micro/go-micro).**

**Online Boutique** is a cloud-native microservices demo application.
Online Boutique consists of a 11-tier microservices application. The application is a
web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items,
add them to the cart, and purchase them.

**Google uses this application to demonstrate use of technologies like
Kubernetes/GKE, Istio, Stackdriver, gRPC and OpenTelemetry**. This application
works on any Kubernetes cluster, as well as Google
Kubernetes Engine. It’s **easy to deploy with little to no configuration**.

## Other Deployment Options

- **Workload Identity**: [See these instructions.](docs/workload-identity.md)
- **Istio**: [See these instructions.](docs/service-mesh.md)
- **Anthos Service Mesh**: ASM requires Workload Identity to be enabled in your GKE cluster. [See the workload identity instructions](docs/workload-identity.md) to configure and deploy the app. Then, use the [service mesh guide](/docs/service-mesh.md).
- **non-GKE clusters (Minikube, Kind)**: see the [Development Guide](/docs/development-guide.md)
- **Memorystore**: [See these instructions](/docs/memorystore.md) to replace the in-cluster `redis` database with hosted Google Cloud Memorystore (redis).
- **Cymbal Shops Branding**: [See these instructions](/docs/cymbal-shops.md)
- **NetworkPolicies**: [See these instructions](/docs/network-policies/README.md)
- **Jaeger**: [See these instructions](/docs/jaeger.md)


## Architecture

**Online Boutique** is composed of 11 microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC. See the [Development Principles](/docs/development-principles.md) doc for more information.

## Features

- **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)/[GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/):**
  The app is designed to run on Kubernetes (both locally on "Docker for
  Desktop", as well as on the cloud with GKE).
- **[gRPC](https://grpc.io):** Microservices use a high volume of gRPC calls to
  communicate to each other.
- **[Istio](https://istio.io):** Application works on Istio service mesh.
- **[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) Tracing:** Most services are
  instrumented using OpenTelemetry trace interceptors for gRPC/HTTP.
- **[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev):** Application
  is deployed to Kubernetes with a single command using Skaffold.
- **Synthetic Load Generation:** The application demo comes with a background
  job that creates realistic usage patterns on the website using
  [Locust](https://locust.io/) load generator.
